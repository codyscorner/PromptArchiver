Perfect â€” hereâ€™s your final Veo 3 video prompt, optimized for an 8-second cinematic scene:

Veo 3 Prompt:

In a dusky, shadow-laced forest, Little Red Riding Hood sprints down a narrow dirt trail, her red hoodie flaring behind her as she runs straight toward the camera. The shot tracks her movement with a slight handheld feel, capturing her panicked breath and darting eyes. Behind her, the towering Big Bad Wolf barrels through the underbrush â€” a dark, snarling blur with glowing eyes and snapping jaws. As Red glances directly into the lens, breathless and defiant, she blurts, "This damn wolf is trying to eat me." Twilight blue light filters through the canopy above, casting long shadows across the forest floor. A faint orange glow from the setting sun backlights the chaos, while leaves crunch and wind rushes past. The atmosphere blends urgency with fairy tale grit â€” cinematic realism with motion blur, streaks of light through trees, and a touch of dark humor. The mood is intense yet sly, grounded in a modern mythic style.
