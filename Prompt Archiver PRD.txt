PRD: Prompt Archiver
1. Overview

Name: Prompt Archiver
Purpose: A desktop application that allows users to store, organize, and view AI prompts alongside their generated outputs (text, images, or videos).
Goal: Provide a local-first archive system where prompts and their associated outputs are neatly organized for quick reference and reuse.

2. Objectives

Centralize prompt management in a single desktop app.

Automatically create local folders and store prompts with outputs.

Support browsing, viewing, and previewing of different content types (text, images, video).

Enable quick retrieval and reuse of stored prompts.

3. Requirements
3.1 Functional Requirements

Prompt Entry

Users can input a prompt into the app.

Option to paste/copy or import prompts from external files.

Save & Organize

Save prompts and associated outputs locally.

Auto-create a top-level folder: Prompt_Archive (default location user can configure).

Subfolders by type:

/text/

/image/

/video/

Each prompt gets its own subfolder containing:

The original prompt (prompt.txt).

The generated output (e.g., .txt, .png, .mp4).

Metadata file (metadata.json) containing date/time, tags, type.

Browsing & Search

Built-in file explorer to browse saved prompts.

Ability to filter by type (text, image, video).

Search prompts by keyword or tag.

Viewing & Playback

Display text outputs inside the app.

Preview images inside the app (standard image viewer).

Play videos inside the app (basic embedded media player).

Tagging

Users can add tags to prompts for categorization.

Tags stored in metadata.

Export/Backup

Option to export prompts or entire folders to another location.

Support ZIP compression for exporting.

3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

Platform: Windows desktop app (later expandable to macOS/Linux).

Storage: Local filesystem only (no cloud dependency).

Performance: Should handle thousands of prompts with minimal lag.

Security: Local-only storage; no external data transmission.

Tech Stack (recommended):

Frontend: Electron (JavaScript/React) or .NET (WinUI/WPF).

Backend: Node.js (if Electron) or C#.

Media handling: Built-in OS codecs/libraries.

4. User Flow

Launch app → Main dashboard shows saved prompts.

Add new prompt → Select type (text, image, video) → Save.

App creates folder structure and saves prompt + output.

User can click on an item → View text, preview image, or play video.

Search or filter by tags, type, or date.

Export selected prompts if needed.

5. Future Enhancements

Drag-and-drop file support for adding existing outputs.

Markdown support for text prompts.

Side-by-side comparison view of prompt vs. output.

AI-powered tagging (auto-suggest categories).

Sync option with local NAS or private cloud (optional, not default).
